## Diaries
A `diary` is a record of what you did each day.

A diary contains folders for each year, which contain documents for each month, which contain these headings:

_Remember_

A few brief notes, quotes, or mottos, to help you focus on what matters to you.

_Soon_

Action items from your backlog. Don't stress too much about ordering them by priority -- our goal is to get this list as small as possible.

_Date_

One heading for each day of the month, in reverse chronological order (so today is always at the top). 

(Throughout Jot, date headings should be formatted like so -- `YYYY-MM-DD -- Dayofweek`. This allows you to use your editor's search function to find anything related to a particular date, or to a particular day of the week.)

Under each date heading keep a list of what you did that day.

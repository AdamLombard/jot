# Workflows

A `workflow` is a sequence of actions you frequently repeat.

For example, you may have a morning routine that starts your workday off right, or a checklist you always like to work through just before giving a presentation. (Pro tip: add 'check teeth in mirror' to that list -- someday you'll thank me.)

This folder contains workflows.

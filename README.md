# Jot
A low-friction task management system, written in [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/), inspired by (and forked from) [Coraline Ada Ehmke](https://github.com/CoralineAda)'s [lftm](https://github.com/CoralineAda/lftm).

## What is Jot?
Imagine having a second head that's good at tracking all the boring details about your workday, leaving your first head free to be the creative genius it was born to be. That second head is Jot!

Jot is an organized set of files and folders in which to quickly offload the to-do lists, project notes, and scattered thoughts cluttering up your brain. It's also a method of using these files and folders effectively.

## How is it organized?
Jot is comprised of five folders:

- [diaries](/diaries/README.md) (the heart of Jot)
- [meetings](/meetings/README.md)
- [projects](/projects/README.md)
- [thoughts](/thoughts/README.md)
- [workflows](/workflows/README.md)

Each folder contains a README giving more details about its use.

## How do I use it?
To start your day, open the parent folder as a project in your favorite text editor. (Might I recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)? It's lovely this time of year.) This gives you all subfolders in a tree view with easy access to their enclosed documents.

Search for `!!`, review the action items that come up, and move any pressing ones into the `Soon` heading of the current month in the appropriate diary.

In the appropriate diary, make a new heading for today's date. Move three to five items from the `Soon` heading down into today.

As you work on your action items, take notes related to the action as a nested list beneath it. As you accomplish action items, remove the `!!`. (This is like checking things off, and prevents the items from appearing in future searches.)

As you work, note every task you complete or start, even if it feels minor. You'll end up with a clean record of what you work on and accomplish each day. :)

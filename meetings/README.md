## Meetings
At the top of each meeting file, under the `Next` heading, keep a list of things to discuss the next time you meet with this group. 

Make a new date heading as each meeting occurs. Jot down notes during the meeting (or immediately after). Capture action items as you go -- prepending them with `!!`.

### group
Keep a single document for each type of group meeting you attend.

### one-on-one
Keep a single document for each person with whom you have one-on-ones.

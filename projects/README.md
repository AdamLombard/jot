## Projects
Create a subfolder for each project.

In the `overview` file for each project there are four headings:

_description_

A brief, general description of the reason for the project -- what problem is being solved and why.

_goals_

A list of goals for the project.

_next steps_

The next two or three actions that need to be taken, prepended with `!!`.

_actions_

An unordered list of all upcoming action items for this project. This is where you dump your brain when you think "I need to remember to...".

### Files
Any miscellaneous files related to your project. Project-specific notes might go in a file here, for instance.
